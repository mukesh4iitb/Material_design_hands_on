**Topics Covered:**
- Installation and setup of `ASE`
- Creating and visualizing atomic structures
- Interfacing with DFT codes (e.g., VASP, Quantum Espresso)
- Running molecular dynamics simulations
- Structural optimization and relaxation
- Calculating electronic and mechanical properties
- Automating workflows with custom Python scripts
